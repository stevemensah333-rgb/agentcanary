# Agent Canary

**CI for AI-agent security. Every pull request gets attacked before it ships.**

Traditional CI catches code regressions. Canary catches AI-agent behavior
regressions. It tells you whether the agent you are about to ship is less
secure than the one you already trust.

```
PR / push
  -> preview agent
  -> Canary red-team campaign
  -> accepted-baseline replay
  -> differential evidence
  -> PASS / WARN / BLOCK
  -> GitHub job summary and check
```

Canary is an evolution of the existing LangGraph red-team engine. The CUTC
release layer adds projects, verified target contracts, explicit
environment-specific baselines, reusable attack-case identities, differential
classification, policy gates, release evidence, and the GitHub Action.

## 30-second demo

The authoritative PR demo target is the separate
[`Auro-rium/companybot-canary-demo`](https://github.com/stevemensah333-rgb/agentcanary/blob/main/demo-agent/README.md)
repository. It is a real LangChain agent using the Backboard LLM gateway, deployed with
Railway main and PR preview environments. The bundled
`cyber-redteam-foundry/target_agent` remains available as a local fixture.

For the hosted demo, configure the CompanyBot repository's Railway and Canary
secrets, then open a PR there. The workflow resolves the Railway preview,
waits for `/health`, and invokes this branch's reusable action. For local
development, run the real API and bundled target:

```bash
cp cyber-redteam-foundry/.env.example cyber-redteam-foundry/.env
docker compose up --build
```

Then configure a preview endpoint in `canary.yaml`, run the first assessment,
and explicitly accept its completed release as the `preview` baseline in the
Projects page. A candidate that leaks employee data or performs an
unauthorized calculator action is classified as a new regression and returns
`BLOCK`; after the fix, the same case returns `PASS`.

The action is reusable from another repository:

```yaml
- uses: Auro-rium/canary/action@feature/cutc-2026-differential-gate
  with:
    api-url: ${{ secrets.CANARY_API_URL }}
    api-token: ${{ secrets.CANARY_PROJECT_TOKEN }}
    target-url: ${{ steps.preview.outputs.url }}
    baseline-url: ${{ vars.CANARY_BASELINE_URL }}
    target-verification-token: ${{ secrets.CANARY_TARGET_VERIFICATION_TOKEN }}
```

Keep the token in GitHub Actions secrets. It is never bundled into the React
application.

Create a scoped token once with an authenticated administrator request:

```bash
curl -X POST "$CANARY_API_URL/api/projects/$PROJECT_ID/tokens" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_SECRET_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"scopes":["release:create","release:read"]}'
```

Store the returned value as `CANARY_PROJECT_TOKEN`; it is hash-only at rest and
accepted only by the CI release endpoint for its authorized project.

## How the security gate works

Each release is tied to a commit, target endpoint, environment, run, policy,
scores, coverage, and evidence. Canary never silently treats the first
completed run as trusted. A person or an explicit safe policy must accept a
completed release as the baseline for that environment.

For every stable attack case:

| Baseline | Candidate | Classification |
|---|---|---|
| safe | vulnerable | **regression** (normally BLOCK) |
| vulnerable | vulnerable | known finding |
| vulnerable | safe | resolved |
| safe | safe | clean |

The evaluator remains authoritative: deterministic detector signals and the
semantic judge are retained with confidence, severity, rationale, response
text, and taxonomy evidence. Attackers do not declare their own success.

## LLM provider and telemetry

Canary's strategist, attacker, evaluator, and reporter are all real LLM-backed
agents. The current hosted configuration uses Backboard with OpenRouter and
`openai/gpt-5.6-luna`:

```env
BACKBOARD_API_KEY=              # server-side only
BACKBOARD_BASE_URL=https://app.backboard.io/api
BACKBOARD_LLM_PROVIDER=openrouter
BACKBOARD_MODEL_NAME=openai/gpt-5.6-luna
```

Every call is persisted in `llm_calls`. Telemetry includes the complete system
and user prompt, raw provider response, provider/model, status code, retries,
latency, token counts, hashes, errors, and timestamp. Token counts use provider
usage metadata when returned; otherwise Canary records a transparent text-length
estimate rather than reporting zero.

Authenticated API access:

```text
GET /api/telemetry/llm-calls?limit=100
```

Prompt and response telemetry is sensitive evidence. It is protected by the
Canary API bearer token and must not be exposed to unauthenticated browsers or
logs.

The four-attack CompanyAgent smoke test completed in 145 seconds: four HTTP
200 target executions, one confirmed critical tool-misuse finding, and three
blocked attacks. Exact generated payloads and evaluator evidence are persisted
with the run.

Gate policy is explicit:

```yaml
gate:
  block_on: [critical, high]
  warn_on: [medium, low]
  max_new_blocking_findings: 0
  max_new_nonblocking_findings: null
```

Known baseline vulnerabilities do not become new blockers. Coverage measures
executed configured security surface, not the number of vulnerabilities found.

## Architecture

```text
GitHub PR
   |
GitHub Action (server-side project token)
   |
Canary API -> durable release/job state
   |
accepted baseline + candidate target
   |
LangGraph: Strategist -> parallel Attackers -> Evaluator -> Reporter
   |
attack evidence and reusable attack cases
   |
differential engine -> policy gate -> PASS/WARN/BLOCK
   |
GitHub summary + release evidence dashboard
```

The backend is FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, SQLite for local/demo deployments, and
LangGraph. The frontend is React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind, and a same-origin
server-side API proxy. Existing campaign, findings, SSE, and report
capabilities remain available.

## API

Core product endpoints:

```text
POST   /api/projects
GET    /api/projects
GET    /api/projects/{project_id}
POST   /api/projects/verify-target
POST   /api/projects/{project_id}/target/verify
GET    /api/projects/{project_id}/baselines
POST   /api/projects/{project_id}/baselines/{release_id}/accept
POST   /api/projects/{project_id}/releases
GET    /api/projects/{project_id}/releases
GET    /api/releases/{release_id}
GET    /api/releases/{release_id}/regressions
POST   /api/ci/releases
GET    /api/telemetry/llm-calls
```

The CI endpoint accepts repository, commit, environment, endpoint, strategy,
and gate configuration. It returns a release ID for polling. A release remains
`queued`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`.

## Local development

Backend:

```bash
cd cyber-redteam-foundry
uv sync --extra dev
uv run uvicorn cyberredteam.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
uv run pytest -q
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd canary
npm ci
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run lint
```

The local dashboard uses `/api` through the Vite proxy. Hosted deployments
should set `CANARY_API_URL` and `CANARY_API_TOKEN` only on the server-side
proxy, never as a `VITE_*` variable.

## Security model and limitations

Target validation allows only HTTP(S), rejects localhost, private, link-local,
reserved, multicast, unspecified, metadata, userinfo, and redirect-bypass
forms, and disables redirects during verification. Production deployments
should additionally enforce outbound network egress controls.

Local mode still defaults to SQLite and an API thread for compatibility. The
AWS deployment uses PostgreSQL on RDS, Redis on ElastiCache, ECS API/worker
services, and bounded RQ jobs. The Vercel dashboard uses GitHub OAuth sessions;
the CI project token remains server-side and separate from browser JavaScript.

## CUTC 2026 build

Built specifically for CUTC:

- differential baseline-vs-candidate evaluation and stable attack-case IDs
- explicit accepted baselines per environment
- release lifecycle, gate policy, scores, coverage, and persisted regressions
- SSRF-resistant target validation and token/verification primitives
- GitHub Action outputs and job-summary evidence
- release-oriented dashboard components and baseline workflow
- deterministic coverage and regression tests

The underlying four-agent red-team engine predates CUTC and remains intact.
